# 🚀 Next-Gen SOC at ANCS  

This project was developed during my internship at the **National Agency for Computer Security (ANCS - CERT), Tunisia's national cybersecurity authority**. It establishes a highly autonomous **Security Operations Center (SOC)** for **threat detection and response**.  

---

## 🔹 Features  

✅ **Infrastructure Setup**  
- Deployed a **secure network architecture** using **OPNsense**, supporting **12+ active connections**.  

✅ **Intrusion Detection & Prevention**  
- Applied **MITRE ATT&CK-based Suricata rules** combined with **Zenarmor**, leading to a **50% increase in threat detection rates**.  

✅ **Automated Host-Based Protection**  
- Integrated **Wazuh HIDS** with **VirusTotal scanning** & **Telegram notifications (via Shuffle SOAR)**, reducing **incident response time by 30 minutes**.  

✅ **Threat Intelligence & Case Management**  
- Deployed **TheHive & Cortex** for **centralized incident tracking and automated threat analysis**.
