# README.md - Next-Gen SOC for Banking System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Next-Generation SOC for a banking system, integrating **SIEM, SOAR, IDS/IPS, and network security tools** to automate threat detection and response. The implementation follows a structured methodology using **open-source security solutions**.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Automate threat detection & incident response
- Enhance network security with **firewall configurations & IDS/IPS**
- Implement a **centralized monitoring system** with visualization tools
- Utilize **open-source security tools** for cost-effective defense
- Provide **hands-on experience** in **SOC operations & cybersecurity**
